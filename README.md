## Overview
### Description
Keeps track of information such as what classes students are in, their daily schedules, locations they like to study at (online is a viable location), hobbies and creates study groups for them based on factors such as class schedule, availability, school year, studying location preferences, shared interests, etc. Primary purpose of the application is to create convenient and effective study groups to help students reach their full academic potential, but is also great for meeting new friends with similar schedules and interests.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Academics
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, similar as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features and would attract a larger demographic, as many college students primarily utilize mobile devices when they are out-and-about.
- **Story:** Connects students from the same university and helps them create study groups easier. At the same time students will be able to find and to reserve a study place/spot where they can go with their new friends/study buddies.
- **Market:** Any eligible student individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would have to register with their university credentials.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as a tool for reserving a study place for an individual and also as an opportunity for one to pair with other students who have similar schedule, students with similar GPA and students who are taking the same classes.
- **Scope:** First we would start with listing all the available study spots on campus. We will be pairing people based on their similar studying schedule, and similar GPA which later may evolve into creating a study groups. Large potential for use with discord, slack and other social media apps. Since a lot of classes have their own class communication channels our app will ease  people to create a study sessions even in times of a pandemic.
